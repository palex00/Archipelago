# Roadmap for Pokémon BW AP

The "barely working" version will still be playable to goal, so it will start with 0.1.0.

Every feature will increase the version by +0.1.

However, do not confuse that with the semantic version naming: `major.minor.build`

Version 1.0.0 will happen when certain important features are implemented.
