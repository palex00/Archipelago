# Important stuff

- check static reappearing to actually make them reappear

# For 0.2.0

- actually use slot data and datapackage from network, playername still per global var kept alive, if not found then prompt to enter playername
- "Challenger's Cave - B1F near stairs to 1F" is actually hidden item
- make tms deprioritized
- Add relic castle room filling with sand as roadblock with item requirement
- add season name to depending locations' names
- add note to excluded locations' names
- item/location groups

# Not urgent

- use what palex sent for any badge and any tm/hm
- inspect bizhawk 2.10
- dig with seasons patch crashes the game, not fixable?
- look through scripts and remove space checking for specific items
- fix evo method ids
- restructure surf/strength/... species to be lookups into one whole catchable_species set
- find a way to prevent softlocks in shuffle tms/hms
- more inclusion rules
- complete levelup movesets
- advertise on ds romhacking servers
- merge wild encounter events with same species
- make simple script compiler, use for starting season, season npc vanish, tmhm hunt npc vanish, and other future stuff
- change catchable_dex_form to catchable_species in location generation
- change rules dict to being filled on the way
- trigger goal before credits
- organize imports for type hints behind TYPE_CHECKING
- level up evolutions also tie to certain areas (to prevent stoutland having parcel)
- rework species lookup tables to both have speciesdata as values, which should also include species name

# Singular reports, cannot recreate, need to wait for more reports

- not receiving key items?
- scientist nathan no text after battle?
- ranger clause talking french after battle?
- Some hidden items are not checkable immediately?
- grunt in pinwheel forest with dragon skull not talking anymore after obtaining the dragon skull
