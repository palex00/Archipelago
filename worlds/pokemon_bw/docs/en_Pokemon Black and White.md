# Pokémon Black and White

## What is this game?

Pokémon Black and White are the introduction to the fifth generation of the Pokémon franchise. 
Travel through the Unova region, catch a variety of brand-new Pokémon you have never seen before, 
collect the eight gym badges, fight Team Plasma, who claim to be the saviors of all the Pokémon, 
and become the champion of the region.
These games present themselves in 2.5D graphics, 
while still using the well-known grid-based movement mechanics and battle UI. 

## How do I set up this game?

If you're new to setting up a custom apworld, type `&apworld` into the game's thread for more information.

Other than that, follow the [setup guide for this game.](setup_en.md)

## Where is the options page?

As this game is not (yet) merged into main, type `&template` into the game's thread for more information.

## I want to contribute to development, how can I do that?

First of all, propose your ideas/changes/... in the game's thread, so we can talk about things beforehand.

The fork of this implementation is found at https://github.com/SparkyDaDoggo/Archipelago/tree/main.

## This game info page looks quite different compared to those of other games...

This game has not been merged into main yet, and people tend to get confused by "not working" option pages 
(which will only work once merged into main).
Once this game does get merged into main, this info page and the setup page will be changed to the default structure.
