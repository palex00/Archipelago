# A guide to the slot value of Encounter Plando

Like already said on the main guide, the slot argument can either be omitted (equal to inputting all slots),
be a single number, or a list of numbers.

The range of allowed numbers depends on the chosen method.
The `Grass`, `Dark grass`, and `Rustling grass` methods have 12 slots (numbered 0-11) each, 
while all other methods have only 5 slots (numbered 0-4) each.

The encounter rate of each slot differs between each method and slot number.
