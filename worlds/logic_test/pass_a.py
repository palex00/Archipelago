"""Pass A: generate the under-test slots together and read their overall spheres.

The Logic Test world calls :func:`run_under_test` during its own ``generate_early``
to produce a faithful generation of ALL the under-test games together (one nested
multiworld, same options, same per-game seeds), then :func:`compute_spheres` to
read the overall (cross-game) sphere structure the Logic Test enforces.

Determinism: a world seeds ``self.random = Random(multiworld.random.getrandbits(64))``
in ``World.__init__``, drawn from the seed stream in player order. So an under-test
world at outer player ``p`` got the p-th draw. :func:`under_test_rng_seed`
reproduces each value and :func:`run_under_test` forces it onto the matching nested
world, so every under-test structure (including entrance randomization) matches the
outer slots regardless of slot order; the nested fill then yields the overall
spheres.

    (addressed) location. The location owner and item owner can differ (cross-game
    placement). Two kinds of placement are never recorded (so they're left in the
    under-test games, like normal play): events (non-integer ``code``/``address``)
    can't be sent over the network, and ``locked`` locations are fixed placements
    the game requires to stay put.

    Because fixed placements stay in the under-test game, gated play never delays
    them: the player picks them up the moment they're reachable, mid-sphere. They
    are therefore collected via closure (like events) and never create a sphere
    boundary. Otherwise a location gated only by a fixed item would be recorded
    one sphere late, making its KEY reachable in play before the previous sphere
    completes — a false logic leak.

    ``count_events`` controls whether events cause a sphere boundary:

    * True (default): each reachability wave collects its events with it, so an
      item unlocked by an event that became reachable in that wave lands in the
      NEXT sphere; events create boundaries, finer spheres.
    * False: every reachable event is culled (closure) before taking each sphere,
      matching ``MultiWorld.get_sendable_spheres``. Events are still collected in
      dependency order, so they never create a boundary; coarser spheres.
