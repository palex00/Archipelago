"""Logic Test: a generic logic-leak tester.

Add this world as one extra slot alongside ONE OR MORE games-under-test. During
generation it generates all the under-test slots together as one nested
multiworld, reads their OVERALL (cross-game) sphere structure, then builds itself
as a linear chain of gated spheres matching it:

* ALL of the under-test games' (networkable) items are pulled OUT and locked into
  this world's own sphere locations (each still owned by its original game).
* In their place, every under-test location receives a ``KEY_i`` macguffin,
  ``N_i`` of them, where ``N_i`` is the number of items in overall sphere ``i``.
* Sphere ``i`` here only opens once this slot has received ``N_i`` copies of
  ``KEY_i``, which releases all of sphere ``i``'s original items.

Play is forced into lock-step with the intended overall spheres. Every check
matters: to open sphere ``i`` you must collect every ``KEY_i``, i.e. reach every
location the model places in sphere ``i`` (across all games). A logic leak (an
access rule looser in the model than the real game) shows up as a hard stall: a
``KEY_i`` the model says is reachable but isn't, so the next sphere never opens.

The reverse leak (model tighter than the real game) is caught by a second signal.
Any under-test location the model never reaches in progression gets no sphere
record; ``pre_fill`` locks a ``Logic Test Unreachable Marker`` there instead of a
``KEY`` (this also stops the outer fill from dropping a real item on it). Since the
Logic Test structure reproduces the model, that location is unreachable in play
too — so picking up a marker means the real game granted access the model proved
impossible: a reachability leak. Under full accessibility every reachable location
is recorded, so markers only appear when accessibility (minimal/items) leaves some
locations off the required path.

Setup: add one Logic Test slot plus one or more games-under-test. Slot order does
not matter; the Logic Test reproduces each under-test game's RNG from its slot
number, so the YAMLs can be in any order.
